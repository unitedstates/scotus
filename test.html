Over 11 days in April 2003, respondent Joshua Frost 
helped two associates commit a series of armed robberies
in the State of Washington.  In the main, Frost drove his 
confederates to and from their crimes. On one occasion, he 
also entered the house being robbed.  On another, he 
performed surveillance in ant
icipation of the robbery. 
Washington charged Frost with robbery and related
offenses. Taking the witness stand, Frost admitted to his
involvement, but claimed he acted under duress.  As clos-
ing arguments drew near, however, Frost's lawyer ex-
pressed the desire to contend both (1) that the State failed
to meet its burden of proving that Frost was an accomplice
to the crimes and 
(2) that Frost acted under duress.  The 
trial judge insisted that the defense choose between these
alternative arguments, explai
ning that state law prohib-
ited a defendant from simultaneously contesting the ele-
ments of the crime and presenting the affirmative defense
of duress. So Frost's lawyer limited his summation to 
duress. The jury convicted Frost of six counts of robbery, 
one count of attempted robbery, one count of burglary, and 
two counts of assault. 
The Washington Supreme Court sustained Frost's con-
viction. It rejected the trial court's view that state law 
prohibited Frost from simultaneously contesting criminal 
liability and arguing duress. </span><span class="font-style-TT1-1">

Frost filed a petition for writ of habeas corpus under 28

910 (2014).
Under the Antiterrorism and
 Effective Death Penalty 
Act of 1996 (AEDPA), the Court of Appeals had power to
grant Frost habeas corpus only if the Washington Su-
preme Court's decision "was contrary to, or involved an
unreasonable application of, clearly established Federal 
law, as determined by the Supreme Court of the United
States," or "was based on
 an unreasonable determination 
of the facts in light of the evidence presented in the State
court proceeding."  28 U. S. C. §2254(d).  Here, the Ninth 
Circuit held that the Washington Supreme Court unrea-
sonably applied clearly established federal law by failing
to classify the trial court's restriction of closing argument
as structural error. 
That decision cannot stand. Assuming for argument's

The second rationale for the 
Court of Appeals' decision 
is no more sound than the first. The Ninth Circuit rea
-
soned that, by allowing the prosecution to argue that it 
had proved the elements of the crimes, but "prohibit[ing]" 
the defense from responding that it had not, the trial court 
in effect "forc[ed] defense couns
el to concede his client's 
guilt." 757 F. 3d, at 917.  By extracting this "conce[ssion]," 
the Ninth Circuit continued, 
the trial court "relieved the 
State of its burden of proving guilt beyond a reasonable 
doubt," "shifted the burden of proof to Frost," and even
"directed [a] verdict on guilt"—all "unquestionably struc-
tural [errors]."  </span><span class="font-style-TT1-1">
Id.,</span><span class="font-style-TT0-1"> at 917–918. 
No. The trial court, to begin, did not prohibit the de-
fense from arguing that the prosecution failed to prove the
elements of the crime.  It instead precluded the defense
from </span><span class="font-style-TT1-1">
simultaneously </span><span class="font-style-TT0-1">
contesting reasonable doubt and
claiming duress. Reasonable minds could disagree whether 
requiring the defense to choose between alternative theo
-
ries amounts to requiring the defense to concede guilt. 
Still more could they disagree whether it amounts to
eliminating the prosecution's 
burden of proof, shifting the
burden to the defendant, or directing a verdict.  In addi-
tion, even if the trial court'
s ruling somehow "forced" the
defense "at least tacitly [to] admit the elements of the 
crimes," </span><span class="font-style-TT1-1">
id.,</span><span class="font-style-TT0-1"> at 913, the Ninth Circuit still would have no 
basis for ruling as it did.  It goes much too far to suggest
that our cases clearly establish that this supposed extrac-
tion of a "taci[t] admi[ssion]" is structural error, when they </span></div></span><span class="font-style-TT0-1"></span></div>

Frost argued below that, even if it was reasonable for 
the State Supreme Court to treat improper restriction of 
summation as trial error, it was unreasonable for it to find 
harmlessness on the facts of this case.  The Court of Ap
